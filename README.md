### Project Description
        Through our project we aim to create a secure, offline-first messaging app optimized for intermittent satellite communication, helping Afghan women stay connected in a highly censored and oppressive regime.Our web page represents a mobile app that can be downloaded in rudimentary phones, it simulates the movement of an emergency message from the user in a remote location , to a 'relay' persons ,through a mesh network ,the message hops from one node to next ,till the message reaches a node that has internet connectivity ,on reaching such a node, message is then transmitted to respective NGO.

### The Problem statement
      Since the Taliban‚Äôs takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, women have faced systematic oppression at an unprecedented level. What were once basic freedoms‚Äîeducation, employment, movement, and even self-expression‚Äîhave been stripped away in a brutal regression of rights.
         - Over 1.1 million girls are barred from secondary and university education.
         - Women are banned from most jobs, including government, NGOs, and even beauty salons.
         - Women cannot travel without a male guardian (mahram) and are banned from public parks, gyms, and restaurants.
         - The opressive Taliban regime has erased women from public life‚Äîincluding banning female voices from radio and TV.
         -  With no education or financial independence, early marriages have surged, leading to severe health and social consequences.
         - Reports show a rise in domestic abuse, forced marriages, and honor killings, with no legal protection for women.
         - While women elsewhere pursue careers, vote freely, drive, and travel independently, Afghan women are living in a prison without walls, deprived of the most basic human rights. What is normal and trivial for others‚Äîtexting freely, choosing their future, or attending a university‚Äîis an impossible dream for Afghan women today.

### The Solution
In this dire situation,our secure messaging app is not just about technology‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline for Afghan women.
         - Even with restrictions, messaging can help Afghan women connect, share, and seek help.
         - In a country where private messages can be monitored, encryption ensures women can speak safely without fear of retribution.
         - This project highlights the dire reality of Afghan women and serves as a technological resistance against digital suppression.
         - NGOs operating in Afghanistan, especially those focused on women‚Äôs rights and humanitarian aid, face severe connectivity challenges due to a mix of political restrictions, infrastructure limitations, and security concerns.
         - The Taliban tightly controls internet access and monitors communication channels, making it difficult for NGOs to securely contact women.
