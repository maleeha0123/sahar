### Project Description
        Through our project we aim to create a secure, offline-first messaging app optimized for intermittent satellite communication, helping Afghan women stay connected in a highly censored and oppressive regime.Our web page represents a mobile app that can be downloaded in rudimentary phones, it simulates the movement of an emergency message from the user in a remote location , to a 'relay' persons ,through a mesh network ,the message hops from one node to next ,till the message reaches a node that has internet connectivity ,on reaching such a node, message is then transmitted to respective NGO.

### The Problem statement
      Since the Taliban‚Äôs takeover of Afghanistan in August 2021, women have faced systematic oppression at an unprecedented level. What were once basic freedoms‚Äîeducation, employment, movement, and even self-expression‚Äîhave been stripped away in a brutal regression of rights.
         - Over 1.1 million girls are barred from secondary and university education.
         - Women are banned from most jobs, including government, NGOs, and even beauty salons.
         - Women cannot travel without a male guardian (mahram) and are banned from public parks, gyms, and restaurants.
         - The opressive Taliban regime has erased women from public life‚Äîincluding banning female voices from radio and TV.
         -  With no education or financial independence, early marriages have surged, leading to severe health and social consequences.
         - Reports show a rise in domestic abuse, forced marriages, and honor killings, with no legal protection for women.
         - While women elsewhere pursue careers, vote freely, drive, and travel independently, Afghan women are living in a prison without walls, deprived of the most basic human rights. What is normal and trivial for others‚Äîtexting freely, choosing their future, or attending a university‚Äîis an impossible dream for Afghan women today.

### The Solution
In this dire situation,our secure messaging app is not just about technology‚Äîit‚Äôs a lifeline for Afghan women.
         - Even with restrictions, messaging can help Afghan women connect, share, and seek help.
         - In a country where private messages can be monitored, encryption ensures women can speak safely without fear of retribution.
         - This project highlights the dire reality of Afghan women and serves as a technological resistance against digital suppression.
       ##- NGOs operating in Afghanistan, especially those focused on women‚Äôs rights and humanitarian aid, face severe connectivity challenges due to a mix of political restrictions, infrastructure limitations, and security concerns.
         - The Taliban tightly controls internet access and monitors communication channels, making it difficult for NGOs to securely contact women.
         -  NGOs are often unable to receive urgent distress calls from women in danger.
    Our project gives a simulation of a mobile app that can be used in rudimentary phones, to send emergency messages to relays which then transmit the messages to respective NGOs using satellite services from partnered telecommunication companies.We hope to lend a hand to NGOs trying to reach people who are in need of dire necessities and help.  
    We used AES algorithm in code for encryption , to send the messages securely to relay and then to needed NGO.
## Technical Details
### Technologies/Components Used
For Software:
- HTML
- programs where stored with .html extension,and output was seen on default browser

### Implementation

# Run
First is the code for simulation of keypad,and sending of alphabetic and numeric values to relay and printing the time when the message was recieved after toggling connectivity ,then the messages are transmitted to needed NGO

     
Second is the code for encryption using AES algorithm and we included the functionality of there being 4 nodes,connected together by mesh network.We intended it to act as extra feature to above program code,so finally it comes as though the input from the keypad goes to a particular relay node in a mesh network of many relays ,there is a message counter for each node, that increments each time a message reaches it.

Both the uploaded codes when used together, will allow user to give a message, the message will be encrypted , then sent to a mesh network of relay nodes,one of the nodes will get the message and as per the connectivity available(here we toggled connectivity manually),the messages will reach intended NGOs,partnered telecommunication companies will aid relays in having connectivity ,as per the connectivity ,the message will hop nodes till it reaches a connected node.
